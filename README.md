# hotel-hospitality-analysis

This is an internship project completed by Fareed Ahmed as part of the B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering program at Presidency University, Bengaluru. The project focuses on analyzing hotel operations data using Microsoft Power BI to support decision-making in hospitality management.

##  Project Overview

 The Hotel Hospitality Data Analysis project is a data-driven initiative aimed at improving decision-making processes in the hotel industry through business intelligence (BI) tools. In a highly competitive sector like hospitality, real-time insights into operations, customer behavior, and revenue patterns are critical for success. This project utilizes Microsoft Power BI to visualize and interpret key hotel metrics, turning raw data into actionable business insights.

The scope of the project includes importing operational datasets, cleaning and transforming the data using Power Query, modeling relationships between different business entities (like guests, bookings, and rooms), and designing interactive dashboards that can be used by hotel management to monitor performance and strategize effectively.

 Key Areas Covered:
Customer Behavior Analysis: Age groups, nationality distribution, guest segmentation, and repeat visit frequency.

Revenue Management: Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR), Average Daily Rate (ADR), and monthly revenue trends.

Operational Efficiency: Occupancy rates, peak season trends, and room utilization.

Guest Satisfaction: Visual feedback ratings, sentiment patterns, and recurring issues.

Booking Channel Insights: Comparison between OTA (Online Travel Agencies), website bookings, and direct walk-ins.

##  Objectives

- Analyze customer demographics and behavior
